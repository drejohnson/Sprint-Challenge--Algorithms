#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
Has a single loop with a complexity of O(n). It's Time complexity increases as `n` grows

b)
Has has a nested loop so the complexity is O(n^2)

c)
Using recursion to count the number of bunnies time complexity of O(n). It's Time complexity increases as `n` grows 

## Exercise II
I would use a binary search. I would start on the middle floor then drop the egg. If egg breaks move down to the next floor. If it doesn't break move up to the next floor. 

This would hav a time complexity of O(logn).
